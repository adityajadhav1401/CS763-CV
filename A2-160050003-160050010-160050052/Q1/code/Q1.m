%% Reason for Normalizing Data
% The normalization is basically a preconditioning to decrease CONDITION NUMBER of the matrix P (the larger the condition number, the nearer the matrix is to the singular matrix).
% Putting it simply, the matrix P (un-normalized) consists of products of image coordinates which can have different scale. 
% The source and target coordinate data are usually noisy. Without normalization, the data from source can have multiple orders of magnitude larger variance than from target (or vice versa).
% The homography estimation usually finds parameters in a least-squares sense - hence the best statistical estimate is found only if variances of the parameters are the same (or known beforehand, but it is more practical just to normalize the input).
% So normalization is essential not only for numerical stability, but also for more accurate estimation in presence of noise and faster solution (in case of iterative solver).
